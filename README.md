We formulate the problem of black-box defense (as shown in Fig. 1) and investigate it through the lens of zeroth-order (ZO) optimization. Different from existing work, our paper aims to design the restriction-least black-box defense and our formulation is built upon a query-based black-box setting, which avoids the use of surrogate models.
